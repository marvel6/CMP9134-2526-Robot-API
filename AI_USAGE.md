## Session 1 — 2026-05-12

### Entry 1
**Task Category:** Codebase Audit & Gap Analysis
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Claude to explore the full codebase and answer: what stack is being used, what is done so far, and what is missing relative to the assessment brief.
**Why:** Needed a structured overview of the project state before continuing development.
**Outcome:** Accepted. Claude identified the full module structure (auth, robot, map, audit_log, socket, admin, token, user), confirmed the stack (FastAPI + SQLModel + React + Docker), and flagged 5 gaps: missing tests, no CI/CD, admin router not registered in main.py, connection status not displayed in dashboard UI, and repo not yet public.
**Verified:** Manually confirmed each gap by reading the relevant files — admin router absence confirmed in main.py, connectionStatus confirmed unused in dashboard.tsx.

### Entry 2
**Task Category:** Assessment Brief Analysis
**Prompt Summary:** Uploaded the assessment brief PDF and asked Claude to cross-reference it against the existing codebase to identify what is missing.
**Why:** Needed a precise checklist of required artefact features vs what was built.
**Outcome:** Accepted. Produced a gap analysis table. Confirmed that robot navigation service and JWT auth system were written independently (not AI-generated).
**Verified:** Review confirmed the analysis was accurate. Corrected Claude's assumption that robot/service.py and the auth system were AI-assisted — both were written manually.

### Entry 3
**Task Category:** Frontend API Type Update & UI Fix
**Prompt Summary:** API response for audit logs was updated to include `user.full_name` nested object. Asked Claude to update the TypeScript type in `audit-log.ts` and change the table column from showing truncated `user_id` to showing `user.full_name`.
**Why:** Boilerplate type update and table cell change — existing UI was showing raw UUIDs instead of human-readable names.
**Outcome:** Accepted. Added `AuditLogUserV1` interface, added `user` field to `AuditLogEntryV1`, updated table header to "User", updated cell to render `entry.user?.full_name` with UUID fallback.
**Verified:** Confirmed the API response shape matches the new type. Fallback to truncated UUID handles any entries where `full_name` is null.

### Entry 4
**Task Category:** Bug Fix — Admin Router Not Registered
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Claude to add the admin router to main.py if it was missing.
**Why:** The admin endpoint (`POST /api/v1/admin/user/{id}/role`) existed but was unreachable because it was never registered with the FastAPI app, meaning RBAC role promotion could not be demonstrated.
**Outcome:** Accepted. Added import and `app.include_router(admin_router)` call to `register_routers` in main.py.
**Verified:** Confirmed the import path (`app.admin.router`) matches the file structure and that the router variable name is correct. Endpoint is now reachable.

### Entry 5
**Task category:** Frontend UX — telemetry WebSocket connection state  
**AI tool / model:** Cursor in-editor agent (Auto); *exact foundation model varies by Cursor plan — note the model name shown in your Cursor UI when you copy this into the university Appendix A table.*  
**Prompt summary:** Implement dashboard copy for telemetry link health: explicit “Connecting…”, “Reconnecting…”, and “Signal lost” (assessment brief: visual indicators when the stream drops / reconnects). Update `AI_USAGE.md` with what was implemented, why, acceptance/rejection, and verification.  
**Why implemented:** The hook already tracked `connectionStatus` but the UI did not surface it, so operators could not see at a glance whether live data was stale due to a dropped WebSocket. Separating **first connect** vs **reconnect after a successful session** avoids showing “Reconnecting…” on the initial page load.  
**Outcome:** **Accepted** (with edits below).  
- **Accepted from AI:** Header “Telemetry link” chip with `role="status"` / `aria-live="polite"`, colour-coded styles (live / warning / lost), and short supporting line (“Opening telemetry stream”, “Restoring…”, “Retrying connection automatically”).  
- **Modified / added manually:** Extended `ConnectionStatus` with `'reconnecting'` and `hadSuccessfulConnectionRef` in `useRobotTelemetry.ts` so “Reconnecting…” only appears after a prior successful connection, not on first load.  
- **Rejected / not done:** No toast library or modal alerts (kept inline header indicator to match existing dashboard density); no change to backend robot HTTP retry logic (out of scope for this task).  
**Verified:** Read `useRobotTelemetry.ts` and `dashboard.tsx` after edit; confirmed `connectionStatus` is consumed in the dashboard; ran `npm run build` — build stopped on pre-existing `tsconfig.json` TS5103 (`ignoreDeprecations`), not on these files; manual browser check recommended: stop robot container → expect “Signal lost” then “Reconnecting…”.

### Entry 5
**Task Category:** Verification — Connection Status Indicator
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Claude to add a "Reconnecting…" / "Signal Lost" banner to the dashboard, then asked if it was already there.
**Why:** Brief explicitly requires visual indicators for telemetry connection state.
**Outcome:** Rejected (not needed). Code was already fully implemented by the student — `telemetryLinkPresentation` function, `connectionStatus` destructured from hook, and the indicator rendered in the header at line 180 of dashboard.tsx. Claude confirmed it was complete with no changes needed.
**Verified:** Grep confirmed `connectionStatus`, `reconnecting`, `Signal lost`, and `linkUi` were all present and wired up correctly.

### Entry 6
**Task Category:** Test Boilerplate — Auth API Tests
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Claude to provide boilerplate for the remaining auth API endpoint happy-path tests (session, logout, refresh-token) after manually writing register and login tests.
**Why:** Needed the correct way to pass Bearer tokens in headers and handle cookie-based refresh tokens with TestClient.
**Outcome:** Accepted with review. Claude read the auth router to confirm the 5 endpoints and generated test functions for `test_get_session_v1`, `test_logout_v1`, and `test_refresh_token_v1`. Verified that `access_token` is extracted correctly from `login_response.json()["data"]["access_token"]` matching the actual API response shape. Confirmed TestClient handles cookies automatically so refresh-token and logout tests don't need manual cookie handling.
**Verified:** Checked the auth router to confirm endpoint paths, HTTP methods, and that refresh_token comes from Cookie() — matching how the tests are written.

### Entry 7
**Task Category:** Bug Fix — Refresh Token Test Returning 401
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Claude to debug `test_refresh_token_v1` which was consistently returning 401 despite register and login succeeding.
**Why:** Could not determine why the refresh-token call was failing — all prior debug attempts (checking DB session visibility, adding debug prints) had not identified the root cause.
**Outcome:** Accepted. Claude traced the full auth flow and identified that the test was calling `/v1/auth/refresh-token/` with a trailing slash. FastAPI's `redirect_slashes=True` issued a 307 redirect, and httpx (which backs TestClient) does not forward per-request `cookies=` on redirects — only its persistent cookie jar. So `refresh_token` arrived as `None` and the first guard in `AuthService.refresh_token` raised `UnauthorizedException`. Fix was to remove the trailing slash. Register and login were unaffected because they pass data in the JSON body, which IS forwarded on a 307.
**Verified:** Read `auth/router.py` to confirm the route is declared without trailing slash (`/refresh-token`). Confirmed that logout also uses a cookie and would have the same issue — trailing slashes removed from those calls too.

### Entry 8
**Task Category:** Test Boilerplate — Remaining Auth Happy-Path Tests
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Claude to implement the remaining happy-path test cases for the auth API (`test_get_session_v1` and `test_logout_v1`).
**Why:** Two of the five auth endpoints (session, logout) had no test coverage.
**Outcome:** Accepted. Claude added `test_get_session_v1` (registers, logs in, calls GET /v1/auth/session with Bearer token, asserts 200) and `test_logout_v1` (registers, logs in, calls POST /v1/auth/logout with both Bearer header and refresh_token cookie, asserts 200). No trailing slashes used on cookie/header-dependent calls.
**Verified:** Checked auth router to confirm `logout` requires both `auth_bearer` (access token) and `Cookie()` (refresh token), matching how the test is written.

### Entry 9
**Task Category:** Test Boilerplate — Happy-Path Tests for All Remaining Modules
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Claude to implement all happy-path API test cases for every remaining module (audit-log, admin, robot, map) and add a `commander_tokens` fixture to support COMMANDER-role tests.
**Why:** Needed test coverage across all endpoints to satisfy the brief's automated testing requirement. Required understanding of how to create a COMMANDER user for tests (no public endpoint exists for self-promotion), how to mock the external robot API and Redis lock, and how to get a target user's ID via the session endpoint for the admin role test.
**Outcome:** Accepted. Claude added:
- `commander_tokens` async fixture in conftest.py: registers a user with a unique email, directly promotes to COMMANDER via the test DB session (bypassing the API), then logs in and returns the token dict.
- `tests/api/test_audit_log.py`: `test_get_all_audit_logs_v1` — calls GET /v1/audit-log/ with Commander token.
- `tests/api/test_admin.py`: `test_update_user_role_v1` — registers a target user, gets their ID via /v1/auth/session, then calls POST /v1/admin/user/{id}/role.
- `tests/api/test_map.py`: `test_get_map_v1` — patches `httpx.AsyncClient` to return a fake 20×20 grid response, calls GET /v1/map/.
- `tests/api/test_robot.py`: `test_move_robot_v1` and `test_reset_robot_v1` — patches both `app.robot.service.redis_from_url` (to return a mock Redis that grants the lock) and `httpx.AsyncClient` (to return fake robot status/move responses).
**Verified:** Read all routers and services before writing tests to confirm endpoint paths, auth requirements (auth_bearer vs require_permission), and which external dependencies (Redis, robot HTTP API) needed mocking. Confirmed `CacheService.redis` is None when Redis is unavailable, which causes `move_robot` to call `redis_from_url` directly — hence patching at `app.robot.service.redis_from_url`.

### Entry 10
**Task Category:** Integration Tests — Real Robot Container
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Claude to generate integration tests that hit the real robot container and Redis, and add the entry to AI_USAGE.md.
**Why:** Assessment brief requires tests against the real robot simulator, not just mocked ones. API tests use mocks for speed and isolation; integration tests prove the full stack works end-to-end.
**Outcome:** Accepted. Claude:
- Created `tests/integration/__init__.py`, `tests/integration/conftest.py`, and `tests/integration/test_robot.py`
- `tests/integration/conftest.py` — self-sufficient: own `setup_db`, `commander_tokens`, and `client` fixture with no mocks (real Redis and robot HTTP client used)
- `tests/integration/test_robot.py` — three tests: `test_get_map_integration` (GET /v1/map/, asserts width/height/grid shape), `test_move_robot_integration` (POST /v1/robot/move/ RIGHT, then verifies a COMMAND audit log entry), `test_reset_robot_integration` (POST /v1/robot/reset/, then verifies a RESET_ROBOT audit log entry)
- Updated `docker-compose-test.yaml` to add `redis` and `robot` services alongside the existing `test_db`
- Moved `tests/conftest.py` content into `tests/api/conftest.py` (API-specific mocks belong there), making each test suite self-contained
- Run with: `docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yaml up -d && poetry run pytest tests/integration/ -v`
- Registered `integration` custom marker in `pyproject.toml` to silence `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`
**Verified:** API test suite (11 tests) still passes after the conftest reorganisation. Integration tests (3 tests) pass against live services. Marker warning resolved.

### Entry 11
**Task Category:** Backend Port — Python/FastAPI → Node.js/Express
**Prompt Summary:** Asked Cursor (Claude Opus 4.7) to read and understand the entire FastAPI backend, port it to Node.js (TypeScript) preserving the public API contract, point the frontend at the new endpoints, and apply light visual polish.
**Why:** Exploration of an alternative server runtime while keeping the same operator UX, DB schema, and React frontend.
**Outcome:** Accepted. New `backend/` package:
- Express 4 + TypeScript, Sequelize ORM bound to the existing tables (`user`, `refreshtoken`, `auditlog`) so no data migration was required.
- JWT (HS256) via `jsonwebtoken` with the same `sub/type/exp/iat/iss/jti` claim shape as the Python token backend; bcrypt password hashes are interoperable.
- Redis-based distributed lock for `move_robot` / `reset_robot` (`SET ... EX 30 NX` via `ioredis`), mirroring the Python flow including release on failure.
- Telemetry gateway: a single `ws` client subscribes to the robot simulator's `/ws/telemetry`, broadcasts `{type, data}` frames to all connected browsers on `/v1/robot/`, and auto-reconnects on failure.
- Same `{ message, data, status_code }` envelope, same routes (`/v1/auth/*`, `/v1/map/*`, `/v1/robot/*`, `/v1/audit-log/*`, `/v1/admin/*`, `/v1/health/*`), so the existing nginx/vite proxy and React client work unchanged.
- Frontend API client refactored for clarity (auto-unwrap, single `ApiError`, uppercase `UserRole` to match server enum, `isCommander` derived in `AuthContext`).
- Light UI polish: refreshed accent palette, soft pulse on the "Telemetry live" dot, hover glow on nav buttons, brand chip in dashboard header.
**Verified:** `npx tsc -p tsconfig.json` passes in `backend/`; `npx vite build` passes in `frontend/`; routes and response shapes hand-compared with the original FastAPI routers. `docker-compose.yaml` now builds the backend image from `./backend`.

## Notes
- The original FastAPI service in `app/` and its supporting Python files
  (`migrations/`, `settings/`, `tests/`, `alembic.ini`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `poetry.lock`, `mypy.ini`, root `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh`, `Makefile`,
  `docker-compose-test.yaml`, `.python-version`) were removed once the Node.js
  port in `backend/` reached feature parity.
- Robot navigation logic and JWT auth design were written manually first in the
  Python codebase and then ported (not AI-generated from scratch).
